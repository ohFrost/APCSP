About letterboxd.com\n\n\u0022Letterboxd is a global social network for grass-roots film discussion and discovery. Use it as a diary to record and share your opinion about films as you watch them, or just to keep track of films you\u2019ve seen in the past. Showcase your favorites on your profile page. Rate, review and tag films as you add them. Find and follow your friends to see what they\u2019re enjoying. Keep a watchlist of films you\u2019d like to see, and create lists/collections on any given topic.

Generally this is accomplished by adding mattes (or \u2018black bars\u2019) above and below the picture area.

If the value of **type** (movie language type) is Language, means the language is both primary and spoken (Primary language and Spoken language).\n4. Some films do **not have a poster** (for natural reasons).\n\n# Found an error or inaccuracy in the data?\n\nThis dataset is the result of painstaking work. After collection and systematization, the data is checked for integrity and correctness.
